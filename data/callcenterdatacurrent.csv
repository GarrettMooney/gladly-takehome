Not only is he a hoarder within the home and in his car, which has caused a plethora of insects and vermin to encroach within his property, but his mental illness has progressed, which is decreasing our property values. Kevin throws food on the side walk and within his front yard including: pork knuckle bones, ribs, turkey carcasses, rice, corn flakes, various fruits and vegetables, eggs, marshmellos, hot dog buns, bagles, and other products to name a few which are left overs he receives from the food pantry. This leftover waste ends up in my front and back yard or under my car, including the bones and scraps. This has also attracted unwanted rodents and other vermin to the area, including excess squirrels, raccoons, crows, mice, and furthermore attracted the stray cat population. The cats now take harbor under my deck and urinate consistently, ruining my yard. The problem is that much of the food which is laid out goes uneaten as these animals are not adapted to eat items, such as marshmallows and corn flakes. Several neighbors, including Edward Steward, residing at 6221 N 63rd St, Milwaukee, WI 53218, also have expressed to me that this debris has become a problem within his yard. We have expressed our dissatisfaction with the problem to Kevin in a pleasant manner, but he does not take our complaints seriously and continues the pattern. This has occurred for over 2 years and has only increased in the past few months. I am seeking help to stop this. I am concerned for my health as I recently found a rodent within my garage, which I know is attributable to this increase in left out waste.

There is a storage room in the basement that has a very musty and mildew-like odor. You can’t see the source of the moisture, but you can smell it. In mid-December I first reported it to him. At first my landlord was very responsive and seemed to care. The first mold specialist that he sent looked at the room and said “oh, it’s a safe mold, if there is any mold” and did no testing whatsoever. Weeks later, I do my own mold testing and pay for it out of my own pocket. I followed the instructions exactly and tested in various areas in the room. Including by the pipe, by the walls (where the first mold specialist assumed there could be mold.) My testing showed Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium was found. One of the samples I did right by the pipe and wall, and that was the most severe. I go to my landlord with all this information and share the reports and he sends a second mold specialist out to do his own testing. That was almost 3 weeks ago on January 13th and I haven’t heard one thing in response from my landlord about the results or any remediation plans. I think this is an uninhabitable condition for ME and MY family. I must be particularly sensitive to molds. A lot of people are so I’m not sure why everyone is downplaying this and not doing any further investigation. My dog is constantly itchy and can’t even stay at the house anymore. I am done being ignored by my landlord and I’m ready to figure out a solution or get me out of this house.""2025-02-02 00:00:00","3784 N HUMBOLDT BL, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53212-1739","Missed Collection: Recycling","2025-02-03 00:00:00","""2025-02-01 00:00:00","2496 W FOND DU LAC AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53206-1015","Street Light Out","2025-02-02 00:00:00","Area dark south of Tamarack southbound""2025-02-01 00:00:00","801 E RESERVOIR AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53212-3482","Graffiti","","located in kadish Park at the band shell""2025-01-31 00:00:00","9034 W METCALF PL, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-2752","Christmas Tree Pickup (DO NOT USE)","2025-01-31 00:00:00","""2025-01-31 00:00:00","2625 S 70TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53219-2508","Recycling Cart: No Cart","","The cart has been missing since was damaged for over 1 week.

There is a temporary round a bout at the intersection of 61st & chambers. Someone hit one of the signs so now there are only 3 signs where there should be 4.
