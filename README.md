## View Analysis

See `explore.ipynb` or [a rendered version](https://nbsanity.com/static/23da61bbe2f5632e51e93974da0ce98f/explore.html) for the time-constrained analysis.

## Reproduce

In a terminal:

* Run `./bootstrap` to create the virtual env `.gladly`
* Source `.gladly/bin/activate` to activate the venv
* Run `jupyter lab`
* Naviagate to `explore.ipynb`

## Thoughts

Given more time, I'd likely explore:

- [ ] location
- [ ] embeddings + UMAP of title and/or closure reason
- [ ] exploring closure reason vs time to close
- [ ] ???

In many ways, this initial analysis raised more questions to dig into than it gave a narrative but this is the flow of things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
