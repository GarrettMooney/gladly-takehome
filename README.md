See `explore.ipynb` or [a rendered version](https://nbsanity.com/static/23da61bbe2f5632e51e93974da0ce98f/explore.html) for the time-constrained analysis.

Given more time, I'd likely explore:
* location
* embeddings + UMAP of title and/or closure reason
* exploring closure reason vs time to close
* ???
